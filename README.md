# Please note

This was compiled using Node-Sass which required the workarounds for HSL and clamp values. I've rebuilt it using Dart-Sass at [Project Theme](https://github.com/HumanAccess/Project-theme) and slightly restructured it to make it more practical to use for theme design, I'll be working on it there from now on.
